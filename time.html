  <p><h4>We define time as that in which events are distinguishable with reference to before and after. The most natural time unit is the solar day which is manifested by passing of day and night.it takes the earth one solar day to complete one revolution about its axis. For astronomical purposes,a different time scale known as sidereal time is used. 
    This is the time interval between two successive passages of a star over the meridian.At the present period,the essential mechanism of the devices used the influence of forces, they repeat with great regularity fixed cycles of their motion.The pendulum of a clock and the balance wheel of a watch are two of such mechanisms
    <p> the stop clock or stop watch can be started or stopped with the use of a knob. the knob can be pressed or pushed. the stop watch enables us to measure small intervals of time very accurately. Stop watches can measure time to 0.1 second</p>
    <p>the unit of time is the second with its multiple units as';</p>
    <p>60 seconds = 1 minute</p>
    <p>60 minutes = 1 hour</p>
    <p>24 hours = 1 day</p>
    <p>The most accurate clocks of all are the quartz crystal clock and the atomic clock</p>
