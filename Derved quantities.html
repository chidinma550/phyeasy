  <h1>Derived quantities</h1>
  <p><h4>They are those quantities that are obtained by some simple combination of the fundamental quantities and unit.they are dependent on fundamental uits to form their own unit</p>
<p>For instance;Area,the formular of area is length and breadth and length and breadth are both fundamental quantities and the unit of length is in metres anthe unit of breadth is also in metre.Therefore the unit of area is metre*metre=m2 </p>
