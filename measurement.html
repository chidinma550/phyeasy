  <h1>UNITS FOR MEASUREMENTS</h1>
  <p><h4>Measurements plays an important role in physics ,but they can never be perfectly exact.We usually note the readings accuracy of the measuring instrument and specify the measurement only in the correct number of significant figure </p>
  </h4>
  <h1>LENGTH;Meter rule</h1>
  </p><h4>The meter rule is graduated in centimeters and millimeters.the smallest graduation of the meter rule is 0.1cm. this is its reading accuracy. Measurements can be estimated up to half this smaller graduation [0.5mm or 0.05cm]</h4></p>
<h2>Parallax error</h2>
<h4>Parallax error is the error in the reading from a scale due to the eye being placed at rhe wrong position when reading the scale</h4>
<h1>LENGTH;The calipers</h1>
<h4>Calipers are used to measure length on solid objects that are in a cylindrical form. The jaws of the calipers are adjusted until they touch the objects in the correct positions The length between the jaws is then measured on a graduated scale </h4>
<h1>LENGTH;The venier calipers</h1>
<h4>these can measure lengths more accurately than the meter rule.To measure small length,to the nearest o.1mm,we use the venier caliper. the instrument has two sets of jaws and two scales, the main and the venier scales the venier scale which slides on the main scale is a smaller scale which enables us to measure a fraction of the smallest division onthe main scale</h4>
<h1>LENGTH;The micrometer screw guage</h1>
<h4>For accurate measurements of still smaller lengths such as the diameter of a wire, the diameter of a small ball or the thickness of a paper ,we use the micrometer screwguage it can measure to an accuracy of 0.001cm.Like venier caliper,the micrometer screwguage has a main scale and a venier scale</h4>
<h1>VOLUME;RECTANGULAR BLOCK</h1>
<h4>We can obtain the volume of a rectangular block by measuring its length ,breadth and height [i.e V=L*B*H]</h4>
<h1>MASS AND WEIGHT </h1>
<h4>Mass is defined as the quantity of matter or 'stuff' contained in a body while weight is the force or pull with which the earth attracts the body towards the centre of the earth </h4>
<h1>DIFFERNT TYPES OF BALANCE</h1>
<h4>To measure with abeam balance, the object is placed on the left hand side pan and standard masses are placed on the right hand scale pan.When raised for weighing, the beam of the balance should swing freely about a pivot in the centre of the beam. Standard masses are added until the pointer swings equal number of divisions on each side of the central mark of the scale .When this happens the masses in the two scale pans are equal. 
 <p>The mass of the object is then obtained by adding the standard masses on the right scale pan.</p>
 <p>The working of the beam balance is based onthe principle of moments and its reading.</p>
